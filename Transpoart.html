<p>Electric Vehicles (EVs): Electric vehicles are vehicles that are powered by electricity stored in batteries, rather than relying on internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline or diesel. EVs offer several advantages, including lower emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants, reduced dependence on fossil fuels, and potentially lower operating costs. The adoption of electric vehicles has been growing worldwide, supported by advancements in battery technology, government incentives, and the expansion of charging infrastructure. However, challenges remain, such as the availability of charging stations, battery range limitations, and the environmental impact of battery production and disposal. Electric vehicles are a significant topic in transportation as they contribute to efforts to reduce emissions and combat climate change.</p>

    Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS): Intelligent Transportation Systems refer to the application of advanced technologies to improve the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of transportation systems. ITS encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, including traffic management systems, intelligent traffic lights, electronic toll collection, real-time traveler information, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The goal of ITS is to enhance transportation operations, optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, improve road safety, and provide travelers with better information and options. By leveraging data and connectivity, ITS has the potential to transform the way transportation networks operate, leading to more sustainable and efficient transportation system</p>
